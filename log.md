# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML5/CSS3 challenges on FCC Front End Certification

**Thoughts:** It was very easy and I had a lot of joy understanding CSS variables and how useful they are. I also made my commiment public. With the feedback I instantly got, I realized I was litteraly on Rails (pun intended), there is no safe way back.

### Day 2: July 5th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also used every freeable minute at work to advance with JavaScript. I learned a lot about objects and the exciting topic of Regular expressions. I did it with a very good JavaScript book From Thunderseb and Johann Pardanaud titled "Dynamisez vos sites web avec JavaScript !".

**Thoughts:** So far, it's a piece of cake, the real challenge is to free up the necessary time. I'm a bit sleep deprived. I plan to sleep well on the weekend.

### Day 3: July 6th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/2 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also read the foreword of  Keith J. Grant's book titled CSS in Depth. It is written by Chris Coyier, co-founder of our lovely codepen. From it I keep the following quote : "The trick to getting good at CSS, as in Othello, is knowing exactly when to do what."

**Thoughts:** Today has been a bit harder. I had my weekly workout yesterday and didn't get time to sleep more than 5 hours. I'm so bit sleep deprived that I look like a zombie. I also bought a rubik's cube. I think it is a good way to sharpen my logic skils while relaxing. It may help prepare me for logic oriented challenges.

### Day 4: July 7th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed some color theory challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I better understood the nuances between the different ways of specifying color in CSS and when to use which, especially hsl. I still don't clearly know if there is an actual difference between rgb and hex format, I'll get back to it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Today has been way  much harder. I slept enough but faced an electricity shortage when trying to code. I felt so determined. When My laptop finally shutdown, I proceeded to code on my android phone, even if it's harder to type. Thank God I bought a powerbank yesterday, It sustained my phone long enough for me to reach my daily goal.

### Day 5: July 8th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design section on FCC Front End Certification.

**Thoughts:** I had to face many interruptions. Unfortunately, few people around me understand that you can stay at home and actually do something serious.

### Day 6: July 9th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I have learnt how important it is to keep everybody in mind while designing the user experience and interface of a web site or app. I think before shipping a project, I should close my eyes and experience it the way a blind person would do. Shutdown all sound to experience it like someone deaf and also unplug my mouse to know how well it'll feel with no pointing device.

**Thoughts:** I had to code in an Internet cafe during my lunch. I am really tired. My current full time job is very energy and time consuming. I am exhausted, I should find a way to rest more.

### Day 7: July 10th, 2018 ###
##############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2/3 of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I have learnt more about assistive devices, how they are used and how widespread they are, mainly among users with disabilities. I also started coding a simple color picker on my spare time at work. I really enjoyed the fact that I am starting to make sense of JavaScript. I found it easy to quickly express the idea into working JS code. I dodged JS for so long trying to do almost everything in the back end, but JS feels more accessible to me now.

**Thoughts:** I had to code in an Internet cafe during my lunch just like yesterday. I also find out why I was so tired. It turns out that I have the flu. I'll be at the hospital tomorrow before working if I can. I hope I'll find the opportunity to code.

### Day 8: July 11th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Completed all of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I've learnt a lot in this section, I didn't pay attention to accessibility in the past.

Thoughts: I took a day off work today to go to the hospital. I have some stomach issues. Finally they found out that I have a too high rate of Helicobacer Pilory (a microbe that can harm the stomach). I should eat less spicy food. This flu makes me so tired, still, I was able to set aside enough time to code.

### Day 9: July 12th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Completed all of the Responsive Web Design Principles challenges on FCC. I also worked on my color picker. It handled hex values as of yesterday. Today I worked on building support for HSL/HSLA and RGB/RGBA values also. I think I'll be done soon. Up to now I have worked on an office computer with restricted access to internet. I keep the code in my head and reproduce it when I come back home. I'll upload it ASAP.

Thoughts: I feel better, the flu is going. With not enough time available, it is hard for me to eat well. I should fix this asap.

### Day 10: July 13th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Worked on designing a website. I was contacted by a friend who is a back end guy to help him design a frontend for his next commercial project. The deadline is really tight (Should ship by tomorrow). I'm not done yet and I think I'll use a template to speed this up. 

Thoughts: I still have a lot to learn about CSS and how to put it all together.

### Day 11: July 14th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Continued working on a commercial website. I am almost done with the design, still have some content to incorporate. I have a hard time making the an embedded youtube video to work. I am trying to dodge their iframe because I want the video to show up only when the user clicks on the button.

Thoughts: I learnt a lot reading the templates code to understand it before tweaking it. The only details I didn't undertands were the popover video and the flex rules. That's the next thing I'll learn on FCC.

### Day 12: July 15th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Continued working on a commercial website and also a color picker app. I have a hard time usging the range inputs.

Thoughts: I was offline the whole day because I forgot my phoe at home. I started typing my solutions on codepen, it's still very simple though.

### Day 13: July 16th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: Worked on my color picker. The project is more challenging than what I thought it would be. the JS object model is kind of weird, especially regarding CSS.

Thoughts: I wanted to use vanilla JS for this but it's really hard. I'll give it another try tomorrow.

### Day 14: July 18th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: Worked on a CMS frontend and integrating more content on my current commercial project.
For some reason, my customer want to get rid of wordpress completely and design an in house cms. Also, I made my first professionnal invoice for a customer. 

Thoughts: I didn't code yesterday, I was in bad shape and had really violent headaches so I decided to take more rest. I realized that I still have a lot to learn about law, accounting and billing issues.

### Day 15: July 19th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: Worked on integrating more content on my current commercial project. This part is really a pain as the former programmer had some really bad coding habits. However, the customer is satisfied so far and is even talking about granting me other contracts. I've also learnt new things about bootstrap and font awesome.

Thoughts: I was in a really bad mood today, but still, I could code a few hours. I feel motivated and see more and more doors opening themselves before me. What will be the outcome at day 100 ? I'm eager to discover it.

### Day 16: July 20th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: Worked on my color picker and learnt a bit more about regular expresions. I tried to integrate rgb and hsl support oon the color picker. hsl values are still strange for now. Need to work wore on it and better understand color theory.

Thoughts: I worked intensively on my current commercial projects the past 2 days because there is a lot of content to integrate and the CMS module is not operational yet. Seems like I did too much because I had serious headaches today.

### Day 17: July 21th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I finished the CSS Flexbox challenges on FCC. What an amazing tool under one's belt. Also read a few pages of CSS in depth.

Thoughts: I was really tired today, but as giving up is not an option, here I am.

### Day 18: July 22th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I finished the CSS Grid challenges on FCC. I really appreciated this section. Many of my frontend questions found their answer in the grid display system. I doesn't fit all uses but is undoubtably powerful.

Thoughts: I was contacted by a local fintech startup to team up with them as CTO. It's my first full time developer job offer since the beginning of the challenge. I think it's not a smart move as from now though. Didn't give an answer yet.

### Day 19: July 23th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I almost finished the Basic JavaScript challenges on FCC, except the Record Collection challenge which is a bit tricky, I'll handle it ASAP. I'll start working on the responsive web design projects tomorrow.

Thoughts: I was more than exhausted today, so I took a day off work for a medical checkup. Turns out I need to pay more attention to what I eat and take as much rest as possible.

### Day 20: July 24th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I worked on integrating more content on my current commercial project. Still have a dozens article to insert and style by hand using bootstrap and at tiimes bare css.

Thoughts: I am preparing my layout for the RWD challenges. Maybe I shouldn't overthink it and just jump in. I took enough rest today and spend some time helping people around the internet and in my city's FCC group. 20% completed. Yay.

### Day 21: July 25th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I worked more on understanding and I built a non rectangular page banner. I also started working on a diagonal image slices. I'm starting to get it, though it still requires some work.

Thoughts: I've been sleepy all the day, I have to sleep more.

### Day 23: July 27th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I spent some time reverse engineering the kryptis.com website to better understand diagonal design and other professional frontend concepts. I tried to implement Jquery localScroll and ScrollTo to an ancient pen of mine but it isn't working yet. Despite trying, I couldn't fix it just yet. Tomorrow I'll try it locally to ensure it's not a CodePen integration issue. 

Thoughts: My sleeping hours are so messed up now because of my work schedule which is too irregular. My schedule varies so much that it feels like a permanent jet lag. Hope I'll get out of this schedule ASAP.

### Day 24: July 28th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I worked on the first chapter of CSS in Depth book. I worked on the concept of cascade and learned how browsers determine which rule is applied to which element. I now have to move on by furthering my understanding of specificity, and inheritance.

Thoughts: After my hour of code yesterday, I was opening Github, twitter, facebook, linkedIn and whatsapp to publish my daily log, but unbeknownst to me, I fell asleep. It felt like an emergency shutdown. I had to work very early this week and I happened to sleep less than 4 hours for 2 days.

### Day 25: July 30th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I worked on the tribute page which is the first project out of five projects that need to be completed in order to receive the Responsive Web Design Certification. Moving on soon. I was really minimalistic on this one because I've understood that in order to be productive, I need to leave perfectionism. My work will get better with time and practice.

Thoughts: I skipped one day to recover the huge lack of sleep from this week. I plan to complete all the 5 projects this week.

### Day 26: July 31th, 2018 ###
###############################

Today's Progress: I worked on the second RWD project, the survey form. I completed the markup and passed all the tests. I won't submit it yet because I want to work on the styling. However, I'll set myself tomorrow as a deadline. I need to learn to choose productivity over perfectionism.

Thoughts: I was surprised to see how much time I needed just to pass all the tests. I also need to find a more energic diet. I've heard about the Keto diet but don't know If it's a good fit for me.
