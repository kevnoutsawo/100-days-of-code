# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML5/CSS3 challenges on FCC Front End Certification

**Thoughts:** It was very easy and I had a lot of joy understanding CSS variables and how useful they are. I also made my commiment public. With the feedback I instantly got, I realized I was litteraly on Rails (pun intended), there is no safe way back.

### Day 2: July 5th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also used every freeable minute at work to advance with JavaScript. I learned a lot about objects and the exciting topic of Regular expressions. I did it with a very good JavaScript book From Thunderseb and Johann Pardanaud titled "Dynamisez vos sites web avec JavaScript !".

**Thoughts:** So far, it's a piece of cake, the real challenge is to free up the necessary time. I'm a bit sleep deprived. I plan to sleep well on the weekend.

### Day 3: July 6th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/2 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also read the foreword of  Keith J. Grant's book titled CSS in Depth. It is written by Chris Coyier, co-founder of our lovely codepen. From it I keep the following quote : "The trick to getting good at CSS, as in Othello, is knowing exactly when to do what."

**Thoughts:** Today has been a bit harder. I had my weekly workout yesterday and didn't get time to sleep more than 5 hours. I'm so bit sleep deprived that I look like a zombie. I also bought a rubik's cube. I think it is a good way to sharpen my logic skils while relaxing. It may help prepare me for logic oriented challenges.

### Day 4: July 7th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed some color theory challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I better understood the nuances between the different ways of specifying color in CSS and when to use which, especially hsl. I still don't clearly know if there is an actual difference between rgb and hex format, I'll get back to it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Today has been way  much harder. I slept enough but faced an electricity shortage when trying to code. I felt so determined. When My laptop finally shutdown, I proceeded to code on my android phone, even if it's harder to type. Thank God I bought a powerbank yesterday, It sustained my phone long enough for me to reach my daily goal.

### Day 5: July 8th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design section on FCC Front End Certification.

**Thoughts:** I had to face many interruptions. Unfortunately, few people around me understand that you can stay at home and actually do something serious.

### Day 6: July 9th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I have learnt how important it is to keep everybody in mind while designing the user experience and interface of a web site or app. I think before shipping a project, I should close my eyes and experience it the way a blind person would do. Shutdown all sound to experience it like someone deaf and also unplug my mouse to know how well it'll feel with no pointing device.

**Thoughts:** I had to code in an Internet cafe during my lunch. I am really tired. My current full time job is very energy and time consuming. I am exhausted, I should find a way to rest more.
