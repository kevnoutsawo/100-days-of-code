# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML5/CSS3 challenges on FCC Front End Certification

**Thoughts:** It was very easy and I had a lot of joy understanding CSS variables and how useful they are. I also made my commiment public. With the feedback I instantly got, I realized I was litteraly on Rails (pun intended), there is no safe way back.

### Day 2: July 5th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also used every freeable minute at work to advance with JavaScript. I learned a lot about objects and the exciting topic of Regular expressions. I did it with a very good JavaScript book From Thunderseb and Johann Pardanaud titled "Dynamisez vos sites web avec JavaScript !".

**Thoughts:** So far, it's a piece of cake, the real challenge is to free up the necessary time. I'm a bit sleep deprived. I plan to sleep well on the weekend.

### Day 3: July 6th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/2 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also read the foreword of  Keith J. Grant's book titled CSS in Depth. It is written by Chris Coyier, co-founder of our lovely codepen. From it I keep the following quote : "The trick to getting good at CSS, as in Othello, is knowing exactly when to do what."

**Thoughts:** Today has been a bit harder. I had my weekly workout yesterday and didn't get time to sleep more than 5 hours. I'm so bit sleep deprived that I look like a zombie. I also bought a rubik's cube. I think it is a good way to sharpen my logic skils while relaxing. It may help prepare me for logic oriented challenges.
