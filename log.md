**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML5/CSS3 challenges on FCC Front End Certification

**Thoughts:** It was very easy and I had a lot of joy understanding CSS variables and how useful they are. I also made my commiment public. With the feedback I instantly got, I realized I was litteraly on Rails (pun intended), there is no safe way back.

### Day 2: July 5th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also used every freeable minute at work to advance with JavaScript. I learned a lot about objects and the exciting topic of Regular expressions. I did it with a very good JavaScript book From Thunderseb and Johann Pardanaud titled "Dynamisez vos sites web avec JavaScript !".

**Thoughts:** So far, it's a piece of cake, the real challenge is to free up the necessary time. I'm a bit sleep deprived. I plan to sleep well on the weekend.
