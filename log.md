# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 4th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML5/CSS3 challenges on FCC Front End Certification

**Thoughts:** It was very easy and I had a lot of joy understanding CSS variables and how useful they are. I also made my commiment public. With the feedback I instantly got, I realized I was litteraly on Rails (pun intended), there is no safe way back.

### Day 2: July 5th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also used every freeable minute at work to advance with JavaScript. I learned a lot about objects and the exciting topic of Regular expressions. I did it with a very good JavaScript book From Thunderseb and Johann Pardanaud titled "Dynamisez vos sites web avec JavaScript !".

**Thoughts:** So far, it's a piece of cake, the real challenge is to free up the necessary time. I'm a bit sleep deprived. I plan to sleep well on the weekend.

### Day 3: July 6th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/2 of Applied Visual Design challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I also read the foreword of  Keith J. Grant's book titled CSS in Depth. It is written by Chris Coyier, co-founder of our lovely codepen. From it I keep the following quote : "The trick to getting good at CSS, as in Othello, is knowing exactly when to do what."

**Thoughts:** Today has been a bit harder. I had my weekly workout yesterday and didn't get time to sleep more than 5 hours. I'm so bit sleep deprived that I look like a zombie. I also bought a rubik's cube. I think it is a good way to sharpen my logic skils while relaxing. It may help prepare me for logic oriented challenges.

### Day 4: July 7th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed some color theory challenges on FCC Front End Certification. I better understood the nuances between the different ways of specifying color in CSS and when to use which, especially hsl. I still don't clearly know if there is an actual difference between rgb and hex format, I'll get back to it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Today has been way  much harder. I slept enough but faced an electricity shortage when trying to code. I felt so determined. When My laptop finally shutdown, I proceeded to code on my android phone, even if it's harder to type. Thank God I bought a powerbank yesterday, It sustained my phone long enough for me to reach my daily goal.

### Day 5: July 8th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design section on FCC Front End Certification.

**Thoughts:** I had to face many interruptions. Unfortunately, few people around me understand that you can stay at home and actually do something serious.

### Day 6: July 9th, 2018 ###
#############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/3 of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I have learnt how important it is to keep everybody in mind while designing the user experience and interface of a web site or app. I think before shipping a project, I should close my eyes and experience it the way a blind person would do. Shutdown all sound to experience it like someone deaf and also unplug my mouse to know how well it'll feel with no pointing device.

**Thoughts:** I had to code in an Internet cafe during my lunch. I am really tired. My current full time job is very energy and time consuming. I am exhausted, I should find a way to rest more.

### Day 7: July 10th, 2018 ###
##############################

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2/3 of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I have learnt more about assistive devices, how they are used and how widespread they are, mainly among users with disabilities. I also started coding a simple color picker on my spare time at work. I really enjoyed the fact that I am starting to make sense of JavaScript. I found it easy to quickly express the idea into working JS code. I dodged JS for so long trying to do almost everything in the back end, but JS feels more accessible to me now.

**Thoughts:** I had to code in an Internet cafe during my lunch just like yesterday. I also find out why I was so tired. It turns out that I have the flu. I'll be at the hospital tomorrow before working if I can. I hope I'll find the opportunity to code.

### Day 8: July 11th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Completed all of Applied Accessibility challenges on FCC. I've learnt a lot in this section, I didn't pay attention to accessibility in the past.

Thoughts: I took a day off work today to go to the hospital. I have some stomach issues. Finally they found out that I have a too high rate of Helicobacer Pilory (a microbe that can harm the stomach). I should eat less spicy food. This flu makes me so tired, still, I was able to set aside enough time to code.

### Day 9: July 12th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Completed all of the Responsive Web Design Principles challenges on FCC. I also worked on my color picker. It handled hex values as of yesterday. Today I worked on building support for HSL/HSLA and RGB/RGBA values also. I think I'll be done soon. Up to now I have worked on an office computer with restricted access to internet. I keep the code in my head and reproduce it when I come back home. I'll upload it ASAP.

Thoughts: I feel better, the flu is going. With not enough time available, it is hard for me to eat well. I should fix this asap.

### Day 10: July 13th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Worked on designing a website. I was contacted by a friend who is a back end guy to help him design a frontend for his next commercial project. The deadline is really tight (Should ship by tomorrow). I'm not done yet and I think I'll use a template to speed this up. 

Thoughts: I still have a lot to learn about CSS and how to put it all together.

### Day 11: July 14th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Continued working on a commercial website. I am almost done with the design, still have some content to incorporate. I have a hard time making the an embedded youtube video to work. I am trying to dodge their iframe because I want the video to show up only when the user clicks on the button.

Thoughts: I learnt a lot reading the templates code to understand it before tweaking it. The only details I didn't undertands were the popover video and the flex rules. That's the next thing I'll learn on FCC.

### Day 12: July 15th, 2018 ###
##############################

Today's Progress: Continued working on a commercial website and also a color picker app. I have a hard time usging the range inputs.

Thoughts: I was offline the whole day because I forgot my phoe at home. I started typing my solutions on codepen, it's still very simple though.

Day 13: July 16th, 2018
##############################

Today's Progress: Worked on my color picker. The project is more challenging than what I thought it would be. the JS object model is kind of weird, especially regarding CSS.

Thoughts: I wanted to use vanilla JS for this but it's really hard. I'll give it another try tomorrow.
